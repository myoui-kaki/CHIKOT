CHIKOT Website Report

I created the CHIKOT website to show and share information about luxury sports cars. The website lets people look at different cars, learn about them, and book a car if they like it. The website has the following pages: Home, Products, About, Contact, and one page for each car with more details.

Design Choices I used simple and modern design to make the website look clean and professional. I used Bootstrap to help with the layout and to make sure the website works well on phones, tablets, and computers. I chose a dark theme for the top menu (navbar) and the bottom section (footer) to give it a fancy look.

The Home page has a welcome section, featured cars, and short previews of the About and Contact pages. The Products page shows a grid of all the cars with pictures and short descriptions. You can click on a car to see more details. The About page tells the story of the CHIKOT brand and what we believe in. The Contact page lets users send us a message using a contact form.

Who the Website is For This website is made for:

People who love sports cars.

Buyers looking for high-end or fast cars.

Visitors who want to learn more about different cars.

Anyone who might want to book or test drive a car.

We made the design and text to look nice and easy to understand for anyone interested in cool, luxury cars.

Challenges I Faced One problem I had was making sure each car had its own page, and that all links worked correctly. Some file names had spaces or were written differently, which caused broken links. I fixed this by renaming the files and checking all the links.

Another challenge was making sure the website looked good on all screen sizes. I had to test it on small and large screens and fix layout issues using Bootstrap.

The contact form was easy to design, but since this is a school project, I didn’t connect it to a real email or database.

Final Thoughts This project helped me learn and practice HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I’m happy with how the CHIKOT website turned out. It looks good, is easy to use, and gives people a fun way to explore amazing sports cars.
